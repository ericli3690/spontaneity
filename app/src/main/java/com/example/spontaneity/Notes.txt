## General Notes on Android Studio for Reference

Activity: a page, or group of pages: the big picture thing the user is doing
Fragment: a subpage, a part of an activity

Inflater: object that transforms the xml code into something that displays on the screen

RecyclerFragment: screen that displays a recyclerView
RecyclerViewAdapter: manages individual elements in the list
ViewHolder: the physical appearance of the individual elements, is basically the binding and is constructed from such
binding: included inside the ViewHolder
Reminder: the data associated with the ViewHolders
    changing the reminder and then sending an update message to the adapter will automatically update the ViewHolder
